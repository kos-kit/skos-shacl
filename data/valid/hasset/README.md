The Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (HASSET) is the leading British English thesaurus for the social sciences. Developed by the UK Data Service, HASSET is used in-house for indexing and retrieval of UK Data Service data, and by many third party organisations. It consists of over 4,000 concepts and covers the core social science disciplines: politics, sociology, economics, education, law, crime, demography, health, employment, information and communication technology, history and, increasingly, environmental science. It was originally developed from the UNESCO thesaurus, becoming a separate product in 1997. Developers and ontologists can find more technical information here on how to retrieve RDF data from HASSET.
